==================

1. rank direct

+ oracle > naive > deepar
+ deepar is close to naive, it seems be able to learn the 'naive' model
+ oracle+statusModeling models are close to naive

2. laptime2rank

+ laptime2rank oracle can be better than rank direct oracle, 
+ oracle + laponly is even better
+ oracle+statusModeling models are worse than naive

how to beat naive, is still a question.
