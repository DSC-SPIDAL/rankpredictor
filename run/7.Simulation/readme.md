7. Simulation
================

What's the error bound of the prediction model on indycar data?

Build a simple model with uniformed pitstop strategy, no crash.

Experiments:

Run simulation, fix the first 50 laps.

When predict with a perfect model, prediction of rank1@lap60(10 laps laters) get accuracy 50%.
